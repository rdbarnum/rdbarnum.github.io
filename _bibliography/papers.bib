  title        = {Experimental and Pilot Investigation of The Impact of Drag Reducing Agents on Filter Performance},
  abstract     = {Drag reducing agents (DRA) are commonly used chemicals in the process and pipeline industry. 
                  The unique properties of DRA allow for the reduction in friction and turbulence at the pipe wall, which reduces pumping and transportation costs for both raw crude and refined products. 
                  Most of the DRA that is injected into product pipelines is assumed to be sheared into small molecules via turbulence induced polymer chain scission by the time it reaches its destination which eventually renders it ineffective for drag reduction. 
                  Although this may sometimes be the case, often unsheared or partially sheared DRA persists in hydrocarbon products which may cause problems for end-users. 
                  DRA has been cited as the culprit for issues with clogging of fuel injectors and fuel filters. Problems of this nature have been reported by end-users of diesel and aviation fuel products. 
                  As a result, it is often in the best interest of refiners and fuel wholesalers to ensure that their products have minimal to no persisting DRA contamination prior to sale. 
                  Filtration is one viable method of lowering the DRA concentrations in fuel products, however the impacts of macro-molecular DRA on filter life and performance is not well understood. 
                  To this end, a study was conducted to investigate the impact of hydrocarbon-based DRA on the filtration systems. 
                  A method to characterize the level of DRA contamination in product fuel, the polymer filtration index (PFI), is presented and utilized to benchmark the performance of a media filter. 
                  Impacts of DRA on filter life and removal efficiency are discussed from an industrial perspective. 
                  In light of the findings, a discussion on filtration as a method for the removal of DRA from diesel fuels is presented.

  title        = {Use of Extractive Separation Technology for Removal of Acid Contaminants from LPG to Meet Product Specifications},
  abstract     = {Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a typical hydrocarbon product produced by refineries and gas plants with a wide range of commercial and industrial uses.
                  LPG streams are usually sour with contaminants that can lead to pipeline corrosion and cause the product to be off specification. 
                  Contaminants commonly found in LPG streams are hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and other sulfur compounds such as mercaptans, carbonyl sulfide (COS), carbon disulfide (CS<sub>2</sub>) and elemental sulfur.
                  The removal of contaminant species from LPG and other fluids is required in order to significantly reduce corrosion potential from LPG products and make the product suitable for transportation or use in downstream processes.
                  <br><br>
                  This study investigated the ability of Pentairâ€™s extractive separation technology to remove acid contaminants from an LPG stream that routinely failed the copper strip test.
                  The goal of this study was to determine the root cause of the copper strip test failures and understand the impact of factors such as contact stages and variable contact time on the removal efficiency of each individual contaminant species.
